                      Song's seem to change as they have pattern to,
                      they transform and grow as we do, we define them and redefine them as we shift,
                      I'll make sure that youre story does not end on earth I whisper into the dark as the notes compliment my spell
                      may your song last until the spin of her grows slow, may even the foundations sink and rejoin solar before your tune and the cut of your smile dissapears completely you may have left this realm when your eyes lost light, but you have freinds and family who keep your memory anchored. I hope to see you again one day my freind. My Crazy-quirky freind and brother who taught me how to smile and laugh even when sad, the first person to define me as 'good'
