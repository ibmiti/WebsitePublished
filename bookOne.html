                    <p style="color:black;">
                      Stars die too, <br />

                  Have you ever looked up into the night <br>
                  Where shadows and bulb dance their eternal linear dance
                  As the void bathes you entirely with its light, <br>
                  And when you peer, do you see their shape? <br>
									Do you press your ear close to hear their songs echo upon all?<br>
                  Do you understand it as a gift? <br>
                  These celestial bodies give their shape to you in their life and even more as they explode beyond their definition <br>
									completely showering our world with ghost-light <br>
                  I used to see this as the finale <br>
                  As the end of ends<br>
                  The point where spectrum glows dark and cold<br>
                  And life ceases to give meaning or add value to final sum<br>
                  But seeing so many local star points go out so quickly in their youth I beg to know the meaning..
                  Of why and how come? Where are we going?
